<div style="font-size:12pt;"><span>Elon: If there are 2 paths and we have to choose one thing or the other, and one wasn’t obviously better than the other, then rather than spend a lot of time trying to figure out which one is slightly better, we’ll just pick one and do it.

<div style="font-size:12pt;"><span>Elon (When asked about the most important qualities of Entrepreneurs): An obsessive nature with respect to the quality of the product is very important, so being obsessive and impulsive is a good thing in this context. Really liking what you do, whoever area you get into, even if you are the best of the best, there always a chance of failure, so it’s important that what you really like what you are doing, if you don’t like it, life is too short. If you like what you are doing, you’ll think about it even when you are not working, it’s something your mind is drawn to, you just really can’t make it work, I think</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12pt;">"At age 15, Musk decided that the path to self-actualization traveled through the U.S. His mother was born in Canada, which was close enough. Musk got a Canadian passport, bought a plane ticket, and arrived in Montreal with little money and no home. He spent the year showing up unannounced on the doorsteps of distant Canadian relatives and doing stints on farms, tending vegetable patches, and shoveling grain. The low point was cleaning out boilers at a lumber mill. “You had to put on this hazmat suit and shimmy through this little tunnel,” Musk recalls. “Then you take this steaming goop and shovel it back into the hole you just came through and wait for someone else to put it into a wheelbarrow.” Musk eventually made his way to Queen’s University in Ontario for two years and then to the University of Pennsylvania, where he got degrees in economics and physics.</span><font face="Times" size="4">”</font><br/></div>

<div style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12pt;">"I'd never seen anything like it," says Chris Thompson, explaining what persuaded him to leave a senior position at Boeing to oversee "structures" at SpaceX. "He was the quickest learner I've ever come across. You had this guy who knew everything from a business point of view, but who was also clearly capable of knowing everything from a technical point of view—and the place he was creating was a blank sheet of paper." Musk says (as do the rocket scientists he works with) that after founding SpaceX, it took him "about two years to get up to speed." How is such a thing possible?</div>

<div style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12pt;">Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Elon Musk's drawing power is that, as strange as it may seem, he is not a particularly charming or charismatic person. Charm and charisma require, first, the desire to be charming and charismatic and, second, the ability to execute; both of these require energy. And Elon, a man deeply attuned to the physics of his energy—its caloric and intellectual and financial and historical value—simply isn't interested in using it to light up a room. And yet there is some…thing whereby Elon Musk enters a room and both the space and the other people in it suddenly seem distilled. What is that—and how does it obviate the questions about charm and charisma and even likability?</div>
